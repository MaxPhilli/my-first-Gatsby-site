      <p>I have taken your family and am holding them hostage. If you would like to see your family again, please deposit $920,000 into my paypal account by wednesday. I know what you did, I know what you have is not yours. I want what's theirs. You have taken advantage of others who trusted you, yet you blackmailed them, for money which you didn't need. You are stable without what you have gained and it's purely an act of greed. You disgust me. I will keep your family captive untill you cough up the money you sad, pathetic peice of human trash that doesn't deserve naming.</p>
      <p>please help me</p>
